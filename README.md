               As a Tester I am responsible for making sure that the products meet the required standards before being released to the public for others to use. I'm responsible for performing text execution, defining a testing approach, track bugs and work to solve issues. Also as a Quality Lead I am supposed to mentor and help assign tasks to the team. Also enforce these quality standards and also to act as a bridge between developers and other project managers to ensure a quality product.
